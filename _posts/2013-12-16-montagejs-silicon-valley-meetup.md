The Silicon Valley MontageJS user group is holding a meeting on Wednesday, December 18. Join us at the [FastMac offices](https://goo.gl/maps/VsjK3) in Santa Clara for dinner, drinks, and free MontageJS training. Introductory MontageJS training (ideal for those of you who are new to the framework) will start at 6:30 PM. An advanced training session, which starts at 7:45 PM, will demonstrate how to incorporate 3d graphics into MontageJS applications with WebGL.

If you attend, you can look forward to meeting other MontageJS users and several members of the core MontageJS team.
