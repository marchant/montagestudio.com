At some point, while working on the MontageJS framework, the question came up what CSS naming convention we should start using. After a [long discussion](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/issues/795) we settled on using the [BEM methodology](http://bem.info/method/definitions/), but changed the syntax a bit. To keep this post short, I won't go into detail why using BEM is a good idea, but rather explain why we chose a different syntax. But first letâ€™s look at some examples:

```css
.digit-Progress          /* package-Component */
.digit-Progress-bar      /* package-Component-childElement */
.digit-Progress--small   /* package-Component--variation */
```

> Note: The `package-` (digit-) prefix is used as a name-space so it wouldn't conflict with other packages/libraries/frameworks.

Now let's take a look at the reasons for choosing this syntax.

### Hyphens (-)
The main reason why we're using a hyphen (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`), has to do with the fact that their behavior is different when __double-clicking__ to select text. Try for yourself:

```css
component__element /* underscores */
component-element  /* hyphen */
```

See how when you're using underscores it selects the part before and after, in this case the whole `component__element`. But with hyphens it let's you select only the part you double-clicked. `component` __OR__ `element`. This let's you quickly edit only the parts you want:

### camelCase
Now what if the component or child element consists of multiple words? We could use underscores like `component_name-element_name`. It would still be double-clickable, but readability suffers since it's harder to see what belongs together. Better to use __camelCase__ which groups each part visually: `componentName-elementName`.

### MainComponent
OK, I think we're getting closer. As a last rule, for the "main" component we use `CamelCase`. The reason for it is to add __emphasis__ and make it easier to distinguish the main component from a child element. Also when using a namespace, the component moves to the second position, which makes it even more important to have it stick out: `package-Component-childElement`

### --variation
We kept the more commonly used double hyphens (--) for __variations__. `digit-Progress--small`. It makes sense, because it pulls the variation (--small) visually more apart and makes it look like it's something "different" than an actual element.

So that's about it. For more details, you can read up on the CSS part of our [naming conventions](http://montagejs.org/docs/naming-conventions.html#toc_3) or take a look at [SUIT framework](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md), which started to use the same syntax and documented it really well.

In the end, whatever [Shade of BEM](http://blog.kaelig.fr/post/48196348743/fifty-shades-of-bem) you choose to cook with probably depends on your personal taste, but thinking about a great UX by improving usability and readability won't hurt either.
