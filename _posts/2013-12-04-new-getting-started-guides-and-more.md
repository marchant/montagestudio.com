The quest to make our documentation the best it can be continues, with the [addition of Composer JSDocs](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1356), a big [normalization of JSDocs](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1358) and exciting [new set-up and Hello MontageJS tutorials](https://github.com/montagejs/montagejs.org/pull/69). They are live at [Getting Started with MontageJS](http://montagejs.org/docs/montagejs-setup.html) and [Hello MontageJS](http://montagejs.org/docs/hello-montagejs.html).

Montage recieved a fix to [call beforeChangeListeners before the change happens ](https://github.com/montagejs/montage/pull/1334) and the Digit Select was fixed to [prevent an undefined item in content breaking drawing](https://github.com/montagejs/digit/pull/54).

[Some](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/pull/63) [bugs](https://github.com/montagejs/mr/commit/6d614201100fb246994dcd1c296ded624dcfc0c5) were found in Mr v0.14.0 and so Mr v0.14.2 was released to fix them. Mop v0.13.5 was released to pick up these changes and also included a [fix for independent modules creating different bundles](https://github.com/montagejs/mop/pull/44).

Minit v0.4.1 was also released to [bump all the dependency versions](https://github.com/montagejs/minit/commit/fc7af5fabeb40d44797dbbc5ed2f8d23974aea5f).
