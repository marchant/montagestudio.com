# Data Binding

>**Note:** We are currently in the process of updating our data bindings overview. In the meantime, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/montagejs/frb/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Functional Reactive Bindings</a> document.

For a comparison between our old way of doing bindings and the new, FRB way of doing bindings, see our [FAQ for the FRB transition](/docs/frb.html).
