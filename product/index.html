    <h3 class="title-xxx">Working Together</h3>
    <p><img class="img--explore" src="/assets/images/home/v-preview.jpg" alt="Preview">These collaborative benefits are especially significant for projects that are undertaken by large teams, working in remote locations.

    <h3 class="title-xxx">Flexible and Composable</h3>
    <p><img class="img--explore" src="/assets/images/home/v-standards.jpg" alt="Components">Working together inside Montage Studio, web designers and developers can easily assemble and edit components. Components are displayed in a simple tool palette, and a graphical property editor makes it easy to discover and populate component properties to build stunning and powerful Web applications.</p>
    
    <p>Montage components are self-contained bits of functionality that can be pieced together like building blocks to assemble complex applications, and these components are built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS â€” the standards-based Web technologies web designers and developers know and love.</p>

    <h3 class="title-xxx">Component Focused</h3>
    <p><img class="img--explore" src="/assets/images/home/v-components.jpg" alt="Components">Montage Studio includes a broad assortment of components right out of the box, making it easy to implement many of the common patterns found in modern Web applications. It's also easy to build and share components, combining business logic and custom user interface elements into new reusable building blocks.</p>

    <h3 class="title-xxx">Works with Montage JS</h3>
    <p><img class="img--explore" src="/assets/images/home/v-framework.jpg" alt="Framework">Montage Studio works seamlessly with the MontageJS open-source framework.
