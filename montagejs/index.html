          <h1 class="title-x">Open Source Philosophy</h1>
          <p><img class="img--float" style="width: 100px; margin-right: 20px;" src="/assets/images/montagejs/github.svg" alt="GitHub">At Montage Studio, open source software is at the heart of everything that we build.  We created the MontageJS HTML5 framework to change the way that developers build software together. To help that vision reach its full potential, we extend that spirit of cooperation to the framework itself.</p>
          <p>MontageJS is open source software, distributed under the permissive <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/montagejs/montage/blob/master/LICENSE.md">BSD license</a>. We develop in the open, in a public <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/montagejs/montage">repository on GitHub</a>. Great frameworks are enriched by the breadth of their ecosystems and the scale of the innovation that they foster. We hope that you will join the MontageJS project and help us shape the future of the Web.</p>

            MontageJS is a modern frontend HTML5 framework designed to create single-page applicationsâ€”fast. MontageJS uses time-tested design patterns and software principles, allowing you to easily create a modular architecture for your projects and help deliver a high-quality user experience. This allows designers and developers to work collaboratively and quickly.</p>

                    <h3 class="title-xxx">Reusable Components</h3>
                    <p><img class="img--montagejs" src="/assets/images/montagejs/components.svg" alt="Components"> MontageJS simplifies rich-client development by offering a modular approach to organizing code and components. Small teams can build applications faster through maximum reusability and larger teams can be more efficient by breaking complex problems into smaller units without stepping on each other during the development process.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="title-xxx">Logicless, Declarative HTML5 Templates</h3>
                    <p><img class="img--montagejs" src="/assets/images/montagejs/templates.svg" alt="Templates"> MontageJS templates are HTML5 documents. These HTML templates encapsulate a component's JavaScript code as well as resources like CSS files and images into a folder with "reel" file extension. Developers can instantiate a component without having to worry about what JavaScript dependencies that component has, nor what CSS or other files it may rely on. This leads to dramatic improvements in reliability and ease of use.</p>

                    <p><img class="img--montagejs" src="/assets/images/montagejs/performance.svg" alt="Performance"> MontageJS supports implicit event delegation and a managed draw cycle. This minimizes expensive layout reflows to provide a better user experience, particularly on hardware-limited mobile devices.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="title-xxx">Functional Reactive Bindings (FRB)</h3>
                    <p><img class="img--montagejs" src="/assets/images/montagejs/frb.svg" alt="FRB"> MontageJS supports simple and two-way data binding between components, objects, and collections, allowing you to coordinate the state between views and models, among other entangled objects. FRB go farther and can gracefully bind long property paths and the contents of collections, as well as incrementally update the results of chains of queries including maps, flattened arrays, sums, and averages. FRB makes it easy to ensure consistent state without having to write a lot of "glue" code.</p>

            <p>Montage Studio is our visual authoring environment for MontageJS. It runs in the cloud, which means that you can use it without installing anything on your computer: simply log in with your GitHub account. Montage Studio has some powerful features that will help you write MontageJS applications faster and more easily. You can use Montage Studio for free when creating open source content, or with a paid subscription when building closed-source content.</p>

            <p>If you prefer to write code by hand in your favorite text editor, you can use MontageJS on your local system. The MontageJS framework is available from npm, the node.js package manager. Read our <a href="http://docs.montagestudio.com/montagejs/montagejs-setup.html">Quick Start</a> guide to learn how to install our helpful set of MontageJS command line tools.</p>

            <p>If you need help, visit our <a href="/community">Community</a> page to discover all the ways you can learn more about MontageJS. You can also take a look at some of our <a href="http://docs.montagestudio.com/montagejs/montagejs-examples.html">sample applications and demos</a> to see MontageJS in action.</p>
