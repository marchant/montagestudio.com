        <p>MontageJS development started under Benoit Marchant and his team while at Motorola Mobility, from August 2010 to July 2012. The project was open sourced on GitHub in July 2012 under a BSD license. MontageJS is currently maintained by Benoit and his team at Montage Studio.  </p>
        
        <p>Montage JS is an HTML5 framework for building scalable single-page applications. It was built to simplify the development and maintainability of expressive HTML5 applications by employing many of the foundations of proven native application frameworks. With MontageJS, developers can build and extend reusable user interface components and modules, bind properties among components and controllers, and synchronize DOM updates to ensure a smooth user experience, especially on resource-constrained devices.</p>
        
        <p>The ideas behind Montage date back to Marchant's tenure at Apple (1999−2010) where he worked on native (desktop-like) user interfaces written in JavaScript. Marchant's goal at the time was to create the equivalent of proven technologies such as Cocoa and WebObjects, but for the web and on the client side to facilitate building applications in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The result of this work was used to build web applications for Apple retail such as One to One, Concierge and Joint Venture.</p>

        <p>In 2010, when Marchant had the opportunity to join Motorola Mobility to work on a new framework for mobile, he took the lessons learned at Apple to build Montage from the ground up using the model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern to partition a MontageJS application into logically distinct units. Although still evolving, with many more components on the roadmap, MontageJS has been used to build production-ready applications such as the note-taking Scratchpad and Tips &amp; Tricks Chrome applications for Google and was used as the basis for developing Google Web Designer.</p>

        <p>Montage Studio evolved as a cloud-based tool for real-time collaborative editing of applications, and can be used in conjunction with the Montage JS framework. </p>
