## Product
Montage Studio offers a new way to rapidly build create clean, high-performance large front-end apps within a uniquely composable architecture that enables real-time creative collaboration in the cloud. It pairs a highly modern JavaScript application framework with an interactive development environment, enabling drag-and-drop simplicity for even the most sophisticated projects.
 
Inspired by the design and philosophy of native development frameworks and tools, Montage Studio helps the Web reach its full potential as an application platform.


## Clean and Intuitive 
Montage Studio provides a clean and easy-to-use interface for assembling and editing components. Components are displayed in a simple tool palette and a graphical property editor makes it easy to discover and populate component properties.


## Flexible and Composable
At the heart of Montage Studio is a flexible component system that emphasizes a composable architecture. Montage components are self-contained bits of functionality that can be pieced together like building blocks to assemble complex applications. And Montage Studio components are built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS â€” the standards-based Web technologies you already know and love.
 
The powerful binding system in Montage Studio lets you connect components to each other, offering greater flexibility than other conventional JavaScript model/view/controller frameworks.


## High Performance and Responsive
Components in Montage Studio define properties that are externally accessible, providing a way for other components to plug into their functionality. And all interaction with the underlying web page is mediated through the component system, resulting in excellent performance and a responsiveness unrivaled by other web-development environments.


## Instantly Collaborative
Montage Studio includes a broad assortment of components right out of the box, making it easy to implement many of the common patterns found in modern Web applications. It's also easy to build and share components, combining business logic and custom user interface elements into new reusable building blocks.

The Montage Studio approach to development offers many compelling advantages. It expands opportunities for code reuse, increases application maintainability, and simplifies collaboration between developers. These collaborative benefits are especially significant for projects that are undertaken by large teams, working in remote locations.
